Earning a B.S. in Cell Molecular Biology and Genetics, she started her career as a Cancer Researcher for the National Institute of Health and the Food and Drug Administration with plans of going to medical school. Realizing this path didn’t feel right for her, she began an ever-important journey of self-discovery by going within, in order to find her true passions and dreams in life.\n\nHer first social entrepreneurial effort emerged in 2004 : a fashion line called pH by phillia, with proceeds supporting various charities close to her heart. pH was featured in Teen Vogue, Nylon, New York Magazine, The New York Times, The Washington Post, MTV, VH1 and has worked with A-List clientele, photographers and projects such as Project ALS, Dressed to Kilt and Bloomingdales / SONY “Hot Rocks” campaign. Forced to close her doors in 2009, she quickly switched gears and entered NYC’s competitive real estate industry. With determination and a positive attitude, she quickly became a successful agent, selling millions of dollars of property for over two years and garnering press in The Real Deal, Brokers Weekly and CurbedNY as \'New York\'s Hottest Broker\'.\n\nBut even more importantly to Phillia, this journey has opened her heart and mind to discover a Natural world that is mystical, magical and interconnected with the path of self-discovery. Through her own scientific observations and theories based on her life experience and being exposed to the metaphysical sciences, she realized the importance of Spiritual Health and how key it is to balancing physical, mental and emotional well-being. In 2006, she began her own healing journey through the practices of Peruvian-based Shamanism, transforming her own spirit from deep within. Realizing how powerful and authentic this medicine was, she became a shamanic healer herself, in order to help the people she loves and those who cross her path. Along the way, she learned that the art of positive thinking and having the courage to dream big has manifested the powerful reality of her life’s vision – to create a way to help others realize their own dreams and to help heal this planet with LOVE!\n\n\n',NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL),

Between my investment and those of our investors, we\'ve built a full product suite and successfully launched, and we now need to really go to market. The money will be used to pay my very competent team, cover legal fees largely related to filing patents, rent some office space, and market our products, for which I\'ve already established significant demand. We\'ve now planned a very detailed marketing campaign that will place us in a handful of strategically placed stores, involve DJs and radio stations targeting our key demographic, and drive them into those stores so they are exposed to our product and share the images produced with their friends.',0,NULL,0,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL),

He has written books of poetry, philosophy, fiction and non-fiction. He has written dozens of songs which he has recorded and performed live on stage. He has won awards as an actor, writer, director & producer of films. He developed his own unique style of digital photography. He created his own interpretations for classical characters like Hamlet and Iago, and performed Shakespeare on stage. He took up golf later in life and became a scratch golfer in only two years. And he created his own groundbreaking methods for health, healing and performance, which create a powerful form of intuitive human intelligence, which he calls Intuitive iQ. \n\nMike\'s athletic and artistic training, combined with his journey out of a challenging life of abuse, injury and addiction, transformed him into the man he is today. In 2011, Mike founded the Intuitive iQ Group on Facebook, a one-of-a-kind community of intelligent, respectful, and supportive people. In that group and on Facebook in general, he developed a global reputation for being someone with very high intelligence and incredible integrity. During 2011 and the first half of 2012, Mike became friends with many industry experts in a variety of fields, people who are creating the future of humanity and who have great insights into what the future will be. Mike\'s friendships with these \"innovators\" caused him to realize that both humanity and the Earth are transforming at in incredible rate, yet the general public is not aware of these changes, and they do not have access to the innovators who are creating them, so he developed the Intuitive iQ Global Intelligence Network at his website IntuitiveiQ.com. The website hosts videos and other important information about these innovators, discussion groups, and other social network qualities that enable all users to create their own pages in the network to promote themselves to and interact with the Intuitive iQ Global Community. The centerpiece of this amazing website is a unique Webseries that Mike created as well. On the Webseries he will interview all of these innovators in a LIVE interactive format, where the audience is able to ask questions and offer insights to meet the Guests and be a part of the discussions. \n\nMike is now preparing to Produce & Host this Webseries.

With virtually no tech industry experience, the former TV producer (and avid baker) has built the site into the largest online community of its kind for food enthusiasts. In the process, she has earned some of the industry’s highest accolades, including back-to-back Webby Award nominations in 2009 and 2010.\n\nWith Babette at the helm, BakeSpace has introduced many innovations including the first online mentor program for home chefs and the first-of-its-kind “Recipe Feed,” which keeps BakeSpace members up-to-speed on what their friends are preparing in the kitchen. She has also helped develop a “new recipe” for social media advertising that enables brands to connect and engage with consumers on a true peer-to-peer level. \n\nPrior to launching BakeSpace, Babette worked for more than a decade producing and directing reality TV. The common thread behind nearly all of her TV projects was an examination of the intriguing lives of ordinary people.\n\n',1,NULL,0,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2013-11-20 21:41:12','2013-11-27 18:37:45',NULL,NULL,NULL),

Why Social Picnik?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you want to be when you grow up?\r\n\r\nIf you ask me Ill laugh and tell you \"I’m not ever growing up, are you?\"\r\n\r\nI’ve learned that life is ever changing and limitless to the desires you hold within yourself. You create your destiny through faith and belief within. If you can think it, you can create it.\r\n\r\nAs you grow older you tend to get told the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside that world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, go to college, save a little money.\r\nThat’s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact- everything around you that you call life, was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.\r\nThe moment that you understand you can poke life and something will actually pop out the other side, that you can change it, you can mold it. That’s the moment your life will change.\r\n\r\nWe should all challenge ourselves to the beat of one simple quote.\r\n\r\n“Think Differently”\r\n\r\nThrough thinking differently I’ve found my life’s desire. To create bigger and better things for all of us now and in the future. To help the things we love today; evolve and change for the future. \r\n\r\nThis desire has brought me to a web start up that I feel can leave a pretty big mark on that thing we call the Internet. Help me to create something we both can share and be proud of. Be apart of something bigger, be a part of\r\n\r\nSocial Picnik.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-Danny Montero\r\n  CEO & Founder\r\n',NULL,NULL,0,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL),

Guided by his lifelong love of\r\nstorytelling, Mitch has cultivated a multi-disciplinary expertise in transmedia and culture\r\nhacking through writing, directing, and producing.\r\n\r\nHe earned his Bachelor of Science from the University of Texas at Austin, primarily\r\nfocused on media production, communication theory, and information mapping. Soon\r\nafter, Mitch completed his Masters of Fine Arts at New York University’s Tisch School\r\nof the Arts. As researcher at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at Tisch,\r\nhe delved into a curriculum that “explores the imaginative use of communications\r\ntechnologies – how they might augment, improve, and bring delight and art into people’s\r\nlives.” Mitch continues to foster his growth within the academic community by speaking\r\nat universities, conferences, and workshops internationally.\r\n\r\nSchultz has also worked as a branding consultant for VisionLab, a progressive HD cable\r\nchannel dedicated to experimental video art. After the successful launch of VisionLab,\r\nhe shifted into independent film production as Director of Development for Ghost Robot,\r\nconceptualizing media, art, and interactive experiences. Constantly probing the elusive\r\nedge of the human-technology relationship, Mitch co-created the I/O Port installation for\r\nNYC’s JFK International Airport and contributed to R&D for Microsoft’s Amnesia Moon, an\r\nepisodic, interactive sci-fi mystery.\r\n\r\nAs a marketing consultant and commercial producer, Mitch honed his branding skills with\r\nglobal clients in the mainstream, and the underground. He segued from the commercial\r\nrealm into developing Spectral Alchemy, a hybrid entity consisting of a “ponder farm,\r\ntransmedia experiences and culture shape shifter;” or ‘bona fide mythology through the\r\nexploration and formulation of revolutionary edicts via an esoteric modus operandi.’\r\n\r\nFollowing Schultz’s 2011 award winning documentary, DMT: The Spirit Molecule, he\r\nrecently launched the DMTRMX project, a multi-platform experience that serves as the\r\nmodel for the four-part MNTTKA Manifesto.

She says of herself, “I am the lowest-maintenance person I know. I don’t labor over how I look.” It’s this natural, devil-may-care brand of beauty that won her modeling jobs when she moved to Italy to study at age eighteen. That was in the Mod Sixties, when Rodin wowed all with her Twiggy eyelashes, over-the-knee boots, maxi coat, and five-inch skirt “that was more like a handkerchief”.\r\n \r\nReturning to New York in the Seventies, Rodin ran a successful, directional SoHo boutique, had stints as a stylist at Henri Bendel in the Gerri Stutz days, and then as a fashion editor at Harper’s Bazaar. Eventually, she became a freelance stylist—acknowledged as one of the best in the business.\r\n \r\nOver the years, Rodin has worked with top photographers, including Gösta Peterson, Michael Thompson, Greg Kadel, Alexi Lubomirski, Dominique Isserman, Ruven Afanador, Alexei Hay, and the late Herb Ritts and Richard Avedon.\r\n \r\nRodin has dressed the most gorgeous and charismatic women in the world—from Madonna and Halle Berry to supermodels Laetitia Casta, Giselle Bundchen, and Helene Christensen. These days, she works closely with Victoria’s Secret’s top beauties, including Adriana Lima, Doutzen Kroes, Chanel Iman, Lily Aldrich, Erin Heatherton, and Miranda Kerr.\r\n \r\nDespite access to ultra-exclusive skincare lines in this heady milieu, Rodin became disillusioned with their anti-aging claims and complicated regimens.\r\n \r\n“What I longed for was something far simpler—products for the here-and-now, that caress the skin noticeably and without any delay. Nothing out there did quite that.”\r\nSo she brought her style smarts, her instinct for beauty, and her demand for perfection to the skincare arena. After experimenting with essential oils in her kitchen for nearly two years, Rodin put the finishing touches on her first dream elixir, the original RODIN olio lusso face oil, in 2007. (The name—which translates as luxury oil —is in honor of the easygoing Italian beauty that has long inspired Linda’s own style). The models and makeup artists she worked with tried and loved it, and soon RODIN olio lusso was selling to a cult following at a few select stores. Magazine coverage and an international buzz followed.\r\n \r\nAs venues worldwide began selling RODIN olio lusso, customers began asking, is there more? Yes, the RODIN olio lusso collection is growing—each new item containing a similar, near-magical blend of essential oils, starting with a body oil, then a hair oil (that is a collaboration with the renowned hair stylist Bob Recine), and most recently a lip balm.\r\n \r\nIn a New York Times profile of Linda, her one-time boss, the design editor Jeffrey W. Miller, had this to say “about Linda, about any person with real style … they make you look at the world in a different way …. and rethink everything. They know how to create tension.” And tension, he added, “”is what creates beauty.”\r\nRODIN Olio lusso—and lipstick—are the only products Rodin uses on her skin and hair.\r\nOh, the beauty of simplicity!',NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL),

AOW, is a new way of looking at work in a business context, it atomizes the invariant activities involved in management of all business objects and surfaces the actions performed for analysis. \r\n\r\nAt the end of 2011 I extended AOW to include an \"implicit\" workflow capability that applied a statistical learning algorithm to eliminate the need for constructing formal workflows between workers in AgilEntity. Thus, businesses that use this workflow can socially create, dispatch and execute work without knowledge of the agents delegated the work, the implicit workflow algorithm (ADA) does all the \"work\". This technology is the basis of the WorkNetz startup that is the focus of this crowd funding profile.\r\n\r\nWorkNetz will for the first time enable any business to run hyper efficiently by emancipating its existing workforce to enable them to work more creatively but also to enable those workers to maximize their inherent value landscapes by working across all the things they can do. This is a required revolution in how we work that will benefit the businesses by allowing them to drastically reduces costs for creating new goods and services and it will allow the workers to work on their own time and be judged only for the work that they elect to do. As the world continues to automate various industries creating displaced worker pools, WorkNetz uses cutting edge statistical learning to apply automation to solve the problem.',NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,NULL),

And my teams – emphasis on \"team\" – have won a variety of International and National awards across the disciplines too. \n\nI\'ve been in the startup world since 1992 with the Billboard team producing the Billboard Music Awards on FOX. I’ve been in “tech” since 1994 bootstrapping my own company, buzz boxx – ideas + products from the street, a “crowdsourcing” business that was years ahead of its time.\n\nI genuinely enjoy working with people and get energy from others who are also constantly curious and all about possibilities. I cherish working with true \"rock stars\" and always eager to mentor and coach along the way. \n\nMy career goal – to be the best that I can be and do what I can to help make the world a better place!\n\np.s.
